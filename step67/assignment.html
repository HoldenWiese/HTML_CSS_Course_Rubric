				Apples!</a>

		<p>Apples are very healthy! Consider this quote:</p>

		<blockquote cite="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/267290.php">"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"
			is an old Welsh proverb that most of us are familiar with, but what makes this fruit so special? What health
			benefits are associated with eating apples?
		</blockquote>

		<p>Also, here is a great video about apples!</p>
